TO DO


Client
  x be able to put things back in 'toolbox'

  x show tails and stuff as being behind the man

Create image of the doll
  - convert divs to canvas, then convert canvas to image?
  - server side via some external API?

Server
  - serve client assets from a server
  - post request sends model data to server and server logs it
    - name
    - password
    - doll model with clothing
    - image

Backend
  - Server puts image in archive
  - Server puts image url into model data
  - Server puts name, password, and model data into db 

Retrieve
  - enter username, password
  - retrieve images from DB

  - put that shit in mongo db

- you can save your doll model to DB
  - set up mongo db that stores model 
  - backbone routing
  - create a flattened image from divs (use some kind of api)
  - save the model configuration

==
notes:
you can bind a backbone view's el to a specific dom element, like this: var view = new View({el: $('#myDivInDom')}), or you can append the view's el to the dom with jQuery
